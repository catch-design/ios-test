Dean Woodward

### Getting started

- Cocoapods are are source controlled so you shouldn't need to do a pod install.
- Change the team in the Target/Signing drop down to run on a device.

### Dependencies

- Alamofire
- AlamofireObjectMapper

### OS Suport

- Supports iOS10 - 11

### Time Spent

- About 4 & 1/2 hours by the time I fixed the little iOS10 bugs.
